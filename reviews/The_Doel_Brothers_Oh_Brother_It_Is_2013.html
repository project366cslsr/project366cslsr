<h5>Review</h5>
<p><small>019/366 <sup>(Project 366)</sup></small></p>
<p><strong>O</strong>h, ... it is the Doel Brothers! Country Rockabilly and Hillbilly tunes are all there. Folk music inserts and real rockin' and rollin' chic make songs sparklin'! Some of them are classy authentic rockabilly tunes with honky tonk mind, some are just rural country rock'n'roll. Played very skillfully and even quite artistically (somehow theatrically a bit). Even hillbilly boogie is so smooth there!</p><br />
<p>A pretty strong feature is superfine rustic vocals. So atmospheric, with merry themes or with ballads, just always. Another characteristic is lyricism. In particular, in their own songs. Compositions fit very well in the chosen genre and sound original. There is even a desire to sing along with chanting.</p><br />
<p>The first track "Educated Mind" is a bouncing and friendly ditty with a dynamic country motive. A good opening song with many showcasing highlights of performers. And a very good runway before the second track "Goin' Away", where rollin' keeps rock with an iridescent tune. This road theme is tightly woven with folk notes. Quite good for Country rock. While the next song "Kissin' Bug Boogie" is an almost Hillbilly act with a boogie craze. One of the covers on the album is well done and smoothly integrated into the style of band. This also applies to the next track. Seamlessly flowed cover song "I'll Do It Everytime" is so amazing! And this fourth track is the beginning of a line of splendid countrified Rockabilly songs. The fifth "Sure You Won't" and the sixth "I Need Your Lovin'" are very kind and melodious, with a good rhythm and with Rockabilly slices. The first of the pair is inspired by Country and the second is replete with authentic Rockin' and Rollin' energy and also with a somewhat bopper tone. The seventh song "Pick You Up" contains something from both previous moods in one balanced form. Danceable and melodic. The eighth song "Whiskey Lovin' Fool" is a raw authentic Rockabilly story. Tough and mean a bit, but lovely. The ninth song "Nothin' 'Bout Love" sounds like an absolute hit to me, however when such a dynamic sound of the next "Tell Me You're Mine" (the tenth track) appears - you should to choose the 'absolute'! In general, the ending of the album is quite diverse and contains many different moods. The only clear and constant is the pretty Rockabilly sound. Besides that, guitar waves are so great with the eleventh "Rockin' Shoes" and cover of "Hey Baby" is so groovy!</p><br />
<p>In general, an album of good quality with a sleek sound. With a huge sense of art and humour (from cover and title to directly music arrangements and related things). Everything is done very modishly (well, old fashioned), clearly and interestingly. At least it's worth a look.</p>
