<h5>Review</h5>
<p><small>008/366 <sup>(Project 366)</sup></small></p>
<p><strong>H</strong>ow shades of authentic rockabillies goes mad! The Sharks are about stylish sound with looney tunes, psychobilly with a huge taste of rockabilly itself. With the sound of own look. Clearly audible double bass, cool guitar rhythm. All this with dangling tune and grunting melody. From time to time with inserts of great floppy sound and sloppy rattle. Always with strict rhythm and bass walking, with speed swings and with an eccentric crazy vocals. Lace and wild-wild mocking. And especially I like the sound of giggling guitar. Also that the sound is based on 'fifties' and on actual understanding. Sweet. Punchy energy of Revival times gives a clear dynamic sound with a rather melodious background.</p>
<p>Album "Phantom Rockers" features confident equanimity in a psycho form. What is surprisingly cool. An unflappable sound and always a little freaky. However, the lyrics are with fairly sensible pieces for the genre. There are so many sure hits that it is impossible to highlight only some of them. In addition, that sound is likely close to (neo)Rockabilly greatness. Due to what you can meet some experiments with sound.</p><br />
<p>The album begins very merrily with bewildered song "Moonstomp". So, just 'do what you want' with such a fast-moving rockin' gurgling. Mad enough rockabilly to be called a (neo). With this tune we roll along crazy chanting forward to "Skeleton Rock"! A smooth intro of the second track leads to imagination of bass thrill. Quite mystical background of song with good enough interpretation by different effects (including the chorus). Everything is very twitchy and foggy, but in an attempt to keep calm. And the ending of the song with a kind of defuse after that. Third song "It's All Over Now" with already a bit more melodious mood and about love story. This slightly bizarre song is a cover and probably based on its the Rolling Stones variation. Track with pretty and bright enough guitar solos. Staunchly expressing lyrics - arrangements with a perfect matching too. After such a story, the next song sounds suitably. "Crazy Maybe" is a really catchy thing! At this point, there is already a feeling of entrancement; but whit this crazy theme, maybe, growing up so fast (despite the fairly quiet pace and just because of the filing by the band). The appearance of ringing guitars is so piquancy there. You can even savor double bass without haste until the fifth song begins to sound with its rockin' and rollin' power. Indeed "Take A Razor To Your Head" is a pretty wild tune with many attributes of real rockin' and rollin' hits. These small tricks very cool dilute the relatively rough composition. The next song "Death Row" appears with an active clang of cymbals, drum bumps and psychotone in other fields. With the seventh song "Love Bites", it is time for experimental sound. However this was enough commonplace for 1983, but still attractive to the crowd. Such a charming melody, but in general the way the vocalist performed it, was a success among some listeners. Although it sounds intimidatingly weird since of it is completely psycho lyrics. Awakening comes with the eighth song "Short Shark Shock". With an interesting introduction, next pearl of the song is a pushy manner of singing. Hot, crazy and wild.</p>
<p>The ninth track "Ruff Stuff" is around soft rockabilly with fancy backing vocals. Even with a spice of Teddy Boy Rock'N'Roll. Which continues to pepper in the next song "Phantom Rockers" too. However with already another side - strolling and bogey motive. Well, that is close to the title of the song. Eleventh track "Charlie!" is a wild country (neo)Rockabilly. Shocking psychobilly speed, lyrical craze and ballad story are so unified there that next song "Slipped Disc" with its sluggish start sounds out of mood. But then the lull .. and it started! Rockin' country wild tune from this a bit psycho and quite (neo)Rockabilly band. Just a chic. But the next song is even more! "I Can't Stop" with so perfect sound, theme, arrangements and tune ups. Just want to recommend listening to this song, and do not want explaining why (since I am just very busy and I can not stop dancing and enjoying listening, but when I back - there is already another huge hit). Fourteenth song "Electrifyin'" is so magnificent. Bubbling rhythm and sparkling vocals with some sound effects make this track more enjoyable. Fancy outro is also good addition. Perhaps, good side of (neo)Rockabilly. Then two bonus tracks from CD release. Fifteenth track "Ghost Train" again on rockin' and rollin' way. Probably softened Psychobilly with (neo)Rockabilly speed. Catchy rollin' rhythm is good. But not as so good as the cover version of "We Say Yeah" is lovely. A very balanced track and a great ending to the album. It makes you want to listen again!</p><br />
<p>These sixteen tracks are already a certain classic of style. The sound of the album is not quite perfect, but nevertheless is a pattern for many. It is just wonderful how lead vocals doing job with manic calm and it is so lovely to hear spiced guitars. A lot of rockin' streams in one whirlwind. Even double bass walking, galloping and bouncing around. The album is spinning shockingly fast with mood of old school Psychobilly and early (neo)Rockabilly.</p>
