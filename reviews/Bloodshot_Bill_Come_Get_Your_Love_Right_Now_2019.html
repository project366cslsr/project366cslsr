<h5>Review</h5>
<p><small>006/366 <sup>(Project 366)</sup></small></p>
<p><strong>T</strong>he artist has a rather impressive discography. And almost unchanged style and mood, but sometimes with attempts to do something special and unique for himself. For example, with greater opportunities for implementation and quality. However I can to think that the most of releases are about songs with a very distinctive style and fully associatively with him. I heard other albums or recordings only in fragments and this, actually, is the first album from Bloodshot Bill that I listened to. By the way, so catchy cover art for the title. Apparently, the recordings were made long ago and long before the release date as I can to understand. The expectations of sound were met, and in some places - even exceeded my expectations. Rockabilly in foggy mist - if you are ready! And mad Hillbilly - if you are crazy.</p><br />
<p>The first song "Come Get Your Love" is awesomely laden and garage with very attractive chugalugs. In fact, a bit alcophonic and frantic tune! Slurping vocals... sweetie toffee. Song even with allusion to a gentle melody! Oh, that is a beautiful country folk solos appearance! However the track is perhaps rather gloomy and around motion with burping. But, actually, it sounds effectively. Not as much spectacular as the next track "Take Me For a Ride" though. The second song is more buoyant and all with a curious effect. Around mad surf and thrash ca-ca-ca craze! La-la loony! Fully crackpot tune, but perhaps it is clear what was the inspiration there. Many will like it. Riding under high freaked tune, boost up as with motor engine and there is also a droll whistling. But then so lovely instrumental ballad appears, oh.. "Stumble" is greasy as is! Coolest cool melody with a little teasing.</p><br />
<p>With the next song, "Don't Say Goodbye", some variety appears. This sleepy love serenade is equal to a cat's meow and howl! Very quivering. Tremulous. Sensual song, full and overflowing of emotions. Then, chic continuation with the fifth track "Only Girl", where is a cool outlaw country rockabilly maybe. From Hillbilly fields, perhaps. The structure of the melody is pretty. Quiet and peaceful at first (but nervously) - suddenly roared snarl. Quiet and peaceful back - roared snarl again. Original decision with adventure sensations. Raw sound and sleazy! The following track "Know Myself" is a bright highlight. Ooh! Wow.. is it still this man?! So tuneful! Twisting, maybe bopping and so rockin' and rollin'. For lovers too. Well, what can be enough to fuzz up?! The seventh "Hook Me" can be, well. Wonderful. Perfect whirligig, how wavy, what a boppin' rattle! Pinwheel almost! Such an ambitious sound only increases with the next track "Do What You Do". Song is a completely and terribly good bop-a-strophy. One of the most straightened tracks. With certain joyfulness, rolling tune and many other sides of style! "Drivin'" track is around garage beat of rock and roll with elements of surf. Well, drivin' surf. As with most of the other tracks, this song is driven-by rock and rollin' with slightly honky tonkin', with mad hillbilly tones and even with surfadelics tides. However strictly pinned to Rockabilly with authentic meanings of it. The next track "Driftin'" is an short and a bit lazy instrumental theme with clear title. Sound is about something around drifting and sensations of grumpy do-wacka-do. The eleventh track "Don't Ever Go Away" is a quite charm. Charm as is! Oomph. Glaringly indeed and rushing enough. Very interesting rhythmical set.</p><br />
<p>"Just Because" is so weird and trashy, but goes to his own style! It sounds more as yet another hit, rather than repeating the success of other songs. The thirteenth track "Drowning" is a tranquil of wildness and numb instrumental. Maybe even with a somewhat stomp background. And the following track "I Don't Mind At All" is very astonishing, but twitching a bit. Very inspired by country and rockabilly classics, fifties itself and own way of rocking. The fifteenth song "One At A Time" with a lovely attempt to combine most unique features of Bloodshot Bill in one tune. Whereas "Honey Dolling" sounds exclusively honeyed. Good end to the album. The song is close to whole sound of "Come Get Your Love Right Now", but also with a fresh breeze.</p><br />
<p>All in all, tuned Rockabilly from Mad Hillbilly artist. But quite greasy and uncouth Rock'n'Roll. Influenced, perhaps, by pretty rustic things. Maybe I can to call this sound as a lunatic roll! Drowsy, fuzzy, illegible, rattling rustle.. but how cocky it is painted! He does it the way he feels it. Come get his sound right now..</p>
