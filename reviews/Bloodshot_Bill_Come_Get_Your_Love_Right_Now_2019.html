<h5>Review</h5>
<p><small>006/366 <sup>(Project 366)</sup></small></p>
<p><strong>T</strong>he artist has a rather impressive discography. And almost unchanged style and mood. But sometimes with attempts to do something special and unique for himself. With greater opportunities for implementation and quality, for example. However I can to think that the most of releases are about songs with a very distinctive style and fully associatively with him. I heard other albums or recordings only in fragments. And this, actually, is the first album from Bloodshot Bill that I listened to. I decided to review this album as most recent one. Although, apparently, the recordings were made long ago and long before the release date as I can to understand. The expectations of sound were met. In some places - even exceeded my expectations.</p><br />
<p>First song "Come Get Your Love" is awesomely laden and garage with very attractive chugalug. In fact, a bit alcophonic and frantic tune! Slurping vocals... sweetie toffee. Song even with allusion to a gentle melody! Oh, that is a beautiful country folk solos appearance! However the track is perhaps rather gloomy and around motion with burping. But, actually, it sounds effectively. Not as much spectacular as the next track "Take Me For a Ride" though. Song is more buoyant and all with a curious effect. Around psycho surf and thrash ca-ca-ca craze! La-la loony! Fully crackpot tune, but perhaps it is clear what was the inspiration there. Many will like it. Surf riding under high freaked tune. Boost up as with motor engine. There is also a droll whistling! Then so lovely instrumental ballad appears, oh.. "Stumble" is a garage as is! Coolest cool!</p>
<p>With "Don't Say Goodbye" some variety appears. Sleepy love serenade is equal to a cat's meow and howl! Very quivering. Tremulous. Sensual song! Full and overflowing of emotions. Chic continuation with fifth track "Only Girl", where is a cool outlaw country rockabilly maybe. From Hillbilly fields, perhaps! The structure of the melody is a pretty. Quiet and peaceful at first (but nervously) - sudden roared snarl! Quiet and peaceful back - roared snarl again! Original decision with adventure sensations. Raw sound and sleazy! Followed track "Know Myself" is a bright highlight. Ooh! Wow.. is it still this man?! So tuneful! Bopping and maybe suitable for Teds! Rock for lovers too! Well, what can be enough to fuzz up! Seventh "Hook Me" can be, well. Wonderful. What is it!? Perfect whirligig! What the wavy! What the boppin' rattle! Pinwheel almost! Such an ambitious sound only increases with next track "Do What You Do". Rolling tune and many other sides of chic! "Drivin'" track is around garage beat rock and roll with elements of surf.</p>
