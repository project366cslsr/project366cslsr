<h5>Review</h5>
<p><small>010/366 <sup>(Project 366)</sup></small></p>
<p><strong>P</strong>retty and lovely schlager rockabilly sound. All is focused on the instruments: doublebass, drums, guitar are there and vocals with a marvelous female voice that makes the distinctly classic rockabilly tunes shine and sparkle. The setting is melodious and conceptual. Singing with, perhaps, a jaunty manner of performance, what is quite suitable for a tribute to Johnny Burnette.</p><br />
<p>The first review of <small><a href="../about.html">Project366</a></small> was with connection to <small><a href="Darrel_Higham_The_Cochran_Connection_1998.html">Eddie Cochran</a></small>. Thus, for the tenth review (and the beginning of the second ten), I decided to choose a release with tribute also to a significant artist. And as an additional feature - the first review with female vocals.</p><br />
<p>Because I think that a vital part of the interest in the band is their frontwoman. This is quite logical and understandable, a charming woman in music is always something attractive and special. When the voice sounds enticing and other musicians can provide cool support, then hits appear. Old School Cats gains, share and have many of the traits of a winsome lady. Since yes, all these songs are well known. But here they are wearing makeup. In their own way. How a woman does. And it turns out to be a quite distinctive peculiarity. With girlish ardor and slightly soaring artistry.</p><br />
<p>The first track is "Sweet Love On My Mind". Stage performance with a relatively entertaining mood. Measured, danceable, recognizable. The second cover song is "Lonesome Train" - ahw! stylish, nifty, bogey. There you really start to think that Lady sings Burnette. All the things that many loved with Burnette look show up there with an amazing lady look.. lady look.. but not least burnetteable than original chic. And it is so good to hear the sweet "You're Sixteen" with that cherry voice! Dreamy dreamy, cute cute... Guitar is pretty atmospheric, double bass is unified with drums on their rhythm building, backing vocals are harmonious enough. And such a beautiful voice became so brightful. The fourth song is a well-known hit and a treat for cats. Uhm... wild tune. "Rockabilly Boogie" as is! Uncouth?! Yeah! Not so crazy, but pretty wild and calmly twirls swirl-a-whirl. Gurgling guitars, twangized delight, chopping chic. Too catchy version. The fifth track "All By Myself" also has some pretty wild arrangements that is good for soft boppin' act. The backing there is a bit fancy (but the voice is still perfect and honeyed). Schlager, pop, rockabilly, bop!</p><br />
<p>Songs are pretty melodic, rockin' and rollin' with shadows of vintage and boppin' tones. Despite many sparkles - it is still quite good rockabilly. No-frills, but interesting. It is possible that these are not the recordings that you can listen to all the time, but you should definitely listen to them at least once.</p>
