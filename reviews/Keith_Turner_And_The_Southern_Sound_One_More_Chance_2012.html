<h5>Review</h5>
<p><small>016/366 <sup>(Project 366)</sup></small></p>
<p><strong>K</strong>eith Turner and the Southern Sound - tuneful, goodly, refined. Harmonica is very professional and the vocals are beautiful and clean. The album contains quite a variety. For example, the stunning title song, "One More Chance", is around melodic Country pop with a Rockabilly tone. There can also be euphonious folk rockin' tunes and modern rockabilly swamp. Of course, with general Rock and Roll solidness.</p><br />
<p>Full of artistry of the best of Country with all the power of rockin' rustic Pop. This is especially noticeable in the first track "Heart Of Gold". An interesting song that starts the tracklist and ends it with an extended version. All is light and soft despite the rather tragic mood. Can be a huge hit with its lovely variation of boom-a-chick-a-boom. And the tune itself is about many common features of the travel themes. The composition also has a magnificent solo (guitars, etc.), which is simply awesome. The second track is a Rockabilly heavied pop with a sweet rockin' rhythmic twist. The vocals made the song even more handsomely and the howling harmonica is so bright. But rollin' forward with the third track. That is a mystery story "Dirty Little Secret", in sound inspired by folk music and even surf mood. Oh, thrilled melody and close to rockin' and rollin' Rockabilly. The fourth track "I Can't Stop Loving" has become just a clear Rock'N'Roll song, some honky tonkin' and some wild tones! The next song "Diddy Wah Diddy" with moods of country roll and stroller ballad, in general, reflecting the name of the band. Moderate arrangement without overdrive, but with exciting and wreck-rocking. Tasty aperitif before the sixth song "Cadillac Walk". This track is much more smokey and also about Keith Turner's southern sound. A rowdy-dowdy walk in the big city. However, roll on! The much more vigorous sound of the seventh track "One More Chance", I think, has to do with Keith Turner's own look and its inspiration from Country folk music. Slightly casual and a little rockin' pop with a shade of good old time artists. The next song, "The Price of Love", is overtuned theme. Harmonica pulled attention over and very appropriately used. Smooth and consonant with a loose melody. The ninth track about a steamroller ballad is fully consistent with the title. Feeling neon lights in almost every note of this rockin' soap opera. The next song "Tick Tock" is an instrumental. Very peppy, mighty and sonorous. Rockabilly tune with high surfin' motion. Great two-minute instrumental. Washin' enough.</p><br />
<p>So, rockin' music with strong Rustic Ballads and Rockabilly dynamics. All is around folk, rockin' and rollin' country pop. Definitely should be awesomely at live. And, generally, it can be treated as a masterpiece of Modern Country Rock / Country Pop with a tidy background of Rock'n'Roll / Rockabilly. Also, due to the specific sound of the guitars, the feeling of surf music often appears. By the way, guitars performance are brilliant. Such a perky and luxuriously (be it rhythm or lead, solo). And besides that, a very enjoyable voice that is very pleasant to listen to. Of course, these are not the only advantages. But quite noticeable ones. There are also some dubious touches, but this is the performers' own way, their choice and creativity.</p>
