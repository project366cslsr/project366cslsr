<h5>Review</h5>
<p><small>359/366 <sup>(Project 366)</sup></small></p>
<p><strong>N</strong>ot the best, but somewhat stubborn and unyielding (neo)Rockabilly. Actually, the lead guitar sounds very attractive and stands out. Some good rhythm work, great solos and a pretty vibe. The tunes themselves are pretty different, but intended to be "memorable". Strenuous double bass and fine rhythm guitar. But vocals are not for everybody. For the rest: fun, excitement and enjoyment of the performance. It's hard to say that there are some very specific features. Rather, quite common. But an attempt at a bright presentation of the material, as well as dilution with a little punky tone and purely rebellious Rock'n'Roll (sometimes with its UK mood), deliver powerful emotions. Not wild. And even somewhat melodic.</p><br />
<p>"Wanderer" is about rockin' running with an epic tune, (neo)Mood, but quite authentic solo guitar flavor. A bit punky feel and fighting vocals. "Tell Me Yes" with such a dreamy and nostalgic melody. The overall composition is a bit tiresome maybe, but the idea is pretty good. Sensitive vibe and lovely tone. "Deadman" starts with cool rocking vibrations and then psycho craze starts to rage. Maybe a kind of fancy and freaky attempt to produce soft Psychobilly. Double bass with its style that is already familiar from previous songs. "Moscow Stroll" is a modish try to perform groovy stroller. Fine one, but cannot be too serious about it. Just fun, perhaps. "Move It" - sadly to write but I like this cover much more than their original songs. Matched their style so well, and even song is a somewhat more sparkled and fancier. But in fact, not so memorable or not about special groove. A set of some chords and spanks. "Train In The Rain" is a fine tune, but so straight tempo. Great potential, just like the second track.</p><br />
<p>They do not quite so (neo) as (neo) is perky for. But they were balancing around. I feel that this is a good debut EP. And it's pretty interesting to look forward to their further recordings. Mostly sets the tone and overlaps other sides - vocals. There are also special charms of the lead guitar and the perseverance of the double bass.</p>
