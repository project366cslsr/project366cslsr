<h5>Review</h5>
<p><small>011/366 <sup>(Project 366)</sup></small></p>
<p><strong>F</strong>emale-fronted band with hot modern Rockabilly sound. Their style is pretty wild, rough and rocking! Good Rock'n'Roll with thoroughgoing rhythm and all-out lyrics. Perhaps so suitable for rockers, bikers and hard doing teds. However some songs are sweetest dish for some psycho fans! And the album itself is good enough for listeners who like modern Rockabilly and Rock'n'Roll with inserts of rockin' Country and different styles of performance from hearty ballads to fancy schlagers. Some songs are very melodic, kind and danceable. So, only tapping to the tune or dancing to the beat. All this is adorned with an indescribably charming female voice. Quite smoky and rockin' vocals. And especially it starts to make sense when you see how beautiful this woman is in real life. Real rockin' lady.. real lady. In this regard, the most lyrical compositions are listened with special thrill and heartfelt feelings.</p><br />
<p>The album "Wanderlust" is full of highly energetic tracks. And these songs are perceived with special chic. Some of them with tough tone of punchy sound. For example, "Ride With The Rockers", "Tight Leatherette", "C'mon Let's Rock" and even more softy "I Love Rock'n'Roll" or a bit frowning "Heartbreak Hotel". Some other songs are more cheerful and tuneful: "Wanderlust", "Make Love To You", "Cheers To You". The rest of songs are more lyrical or experimental. "No Escape" and "Girls Girls Girls" with exclusive for this album sound. And "Our Love Is Like A Swamp", "Love Is My Only Friend", "Only Time Will Tell", "I Love You True" are about more intimate meaning.</p><br />
<p>Album "Wanderlust" begins quite revealingly with a cover version of clearly titled song "I Love Rock'n'Roll". However the album ends with the same song (almost.. since of hidden surprise). Well, good start.. good end. The opening song gives a very good charge. Instrumental side of sound is well-balanced and thrumming tune itself is a chic. Guitar, doublebass, drums - good, spiced voice - perfect! Lead and backing vocals are ideal there. You are completely drawn into this motive and suddenly the track is over. But not! Small pause and a fresh rhythm acceleration. Explosion is still there. Four minutes of a real drive. Is it tiring? But how to stop? With the radio version of the song (fifteenth track) - situation is more clear and thanks to bonus track. But with the tracklist order and its second track "Ride With The Rockers" - roll has no plans to stop the rockin' ride. Although it turns into a slightly harsh shade. Modern Rockabilly dedicated to Rockers. Lyrics, rhythm, power. Raging sound. Strong mood continues with the next song "Tight Leatherette". The stubbornly plain text with too expressive performance sounds just stunning as can be. Well, nutty tune (toppingly). The fourth song "No Escape" is already with a rather depressing title. This also applies to the text, but not to the melody. The tune is very adventure. With rockin' and rollin' country epic taste. In fact, the instrumental side is very pleasant. The fifth track "Girls Girls Girls" comes with a fancy appearance and voodoo mood. Kind of shakin' schlager. The two previous songs started a line of relatively melodious tracks. "Our Love Is Like A Swamp" is one of tuneful love stories on the album. So, the recklessness of the first compositions is replaced by a quiet bopping lyricism. Still rockin' and still rollin'. Even wonderfully and rustic, as with the seventh track "Love Is My Only Friend". I like these countrified melody and hearty singing. Cheerfulness completely returns in the eighth track "Wanderlust". It is not even clear why - but it is a very catchy thing. I can, of course, try to explain why this or that sensation arises - but still I just want to describe the feelings that felt due to these moments. The urge to smile, be touched and to dream a little. This is great because a good mood often leads to something exciting, like the next song "Make Love To You". In this song, the vocalist's peculiarity is very strongly felt. And the composition itself warms up the listener before the tenth track "Cheers To You". I can call this song a gem. Very melodic, kind and energetic as in the best traditions of fifties Rock'N'Roll by old fashioned artists like Eddie Cochran. Yes, there is a modern sound but still with lovely vibrations and sweet tides. In addition, great lyrics and sung by a woman. Gentle tones. The next song is "Only Time Will Tell", sensual mood of Rockabilly with a dramatic love story. Twelfth composition continues with Modern Rockabilly force. "Heartbreak Hotel" with a mighty musical arrangement. The next song "I Love You True" is a very lyrical love serenade with amazing beauty of presentation. True sincerity of Rock ballad. The longest track, but it is fair. The fourteenth track "C'mon Let's Rock" is a killer song! As with some other songs, indescribable power is here. High energy, high voltage. After listening to the song, the obvious conclusion remains - come on let us rock tonight! As with the entire music album, the special charm is that the song is fronted by a woman. This adds a distinct gloss, rockin' one! Without any strange jokes, but with joy. All with the solidity, done seriously, efficiently and creatively.</p>
<br />
<p>I could highlight the seventh track "Love Is My Only Friend" as the most balanced song. Different parts of the song contains almost all the features of the album and the charms of this band. However, certain pieces are more lovely with other songs in which they are the main catchy point. There is also a great kind of the hidden bonus track. Pretty amazing stuff to want to listen to this release. In general, the album permeates the general mood of pep, drive and desire to start up or just give a start. Although against the backdrop of a certain longing, fatigue and sorrows. But then you will feel a fresh breeze and understand that everything is alright.</p>
